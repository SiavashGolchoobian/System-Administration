crontab files placed on:
/etc/crontab						defined jobs
/etc/cron.allow
/etc/cron.deny


# Example of job definition in /etc/crontab file:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed

you should not modify /etc/crontab file directly, instead use crontab commands as below:
crontab -l												show current user defined jobs in crontab
crontab -e 												edit current user crontab file


!!! additional to crond that it's resolution is in minutes, you can use systemd.timer unit object as bellow:
sudo systemd-run --on-active=45 ping -c 5 server-b		this command scheduled to run ping command once, 45 seconds after now. this command resulting to automatically creating a system wide service that calles by systemd.timer when time criteria was matches.
sudo systemctl list-timers								show time base jobs created via systemd.timer
