Btrfs, XFS, and ext4 are popular Linux file systems that implement journaling.
Unlike ext3/ext2, the ext4 file system does not use the indirect block mapping approach. Instead, it uses the concept of extents. An extent is a way of representing contiguous physical blocks of storage on a file system.
ext4 supports online defragmentation of individual files or an entire file system.
The ext4 system, on the other hand, is able to support maximum file system sizes of 1EB (exabyte) as well as maximum individual file sizes of up to 16TB each.

XFS is considered a Big Iron file system, meaning it is enterprise grade, high performance, reliable, scalable, well tested, and so on. Its features include:
• Quick recovery and support for extended attributes
• Support for file systems as large as 8 exbibytes (8EiB or ~8 million terabytes)
• Support for a maximum file size of 8 exbibytes (8EiB or ~8 million terabytes)
• Support for as close to raw input/output performance that the underlying hardware can provide
• Online defragmentation and online resizing
