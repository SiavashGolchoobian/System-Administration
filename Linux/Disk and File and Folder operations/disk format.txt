# Formating disk or usb flash device presented at /dev/sdb2 with ext4 file system
# For anything with higher capability, XFS tends to be faster. ... In general, Ext3 or Ext4 is better if an application uses a single read/write thread and small files, while XFS shines when an application uses multiple read/write threads and bigger files
# XFS is 2x~4x faster than ext4, and ext4 is 10x faster than ext3.
