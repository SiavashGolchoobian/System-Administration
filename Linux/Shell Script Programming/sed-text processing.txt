#Stream editor, edit stream of text in realtime, in sed stream unit of measure is line, then each line is a bucket in stream
sed [-n] [-i[.bak]] [<n>q] [<command>] <filename>
	-n							#run in silent mode (do not print content when read it, by default is disabled)
	-i							#do correction inplace (rewrite modifications on original input file), by default sed does not apply any modification on original file.
	-i.bak						#same as -i but before replace original file take backup from original one and then modify old file.
	<n>q						#exist from stream processing on line number <n>, for example quit from sed after processing line number 10: sed 10q file.txt 
	<command>:
		p 						#print stream to stdout
		d 						#delete stream from stdout, for example delete second line from file.txt: sed -n '2d' file.txt
		<n>						#process line <n>, for example to pint first line: sed -n '1p' file.txt
		<!n>					#does not process line <n>, for example not to pint first line: sed -n '1!p' file.txt
		<n>,<m>					#process line <n> to <m>, for example to pint line 1 to 5: sed -n '1,5p' file.txt
		<n>,<+m>				#process line <n> to <n+m>, for example to pint line 1 till next 4 lines (or to line 5): sed -n '1,+4p' file.txt
		s<seperatorChar><oldtext><seperatorChar><newtext><seperatorChar>[<n>|g|i]	
								#replace <n>'th occurranc of <oldtext> with <newtext> in input stream (each line)
								#g means all occurance (globally)
								#i ignore case
		\s						#means any type of space like space, tab and so on
		\b						#means start of word

Example01:
	echo 'sunday is a pleasent day' | sed -n 's/day/night/'
	echo 'sunday is a pleasent day' | sed -n 's/day/night/2'
	echo 'sunday is a pleasent day' | sed -n 's/day/night/g'
	echo 'sunday is a pleasent day' | sed -n 's_day_night_'
	echo 'sunday is a pleasent day' | sed -n 's/\bw/W/g'		#Means replace any word started by "w" with "W"
	echo 'sunday is a pleasent day' | sed -n '5!s/\bw/W/g'		#Means replace any word started by "w" with "W" but ignore line number 5 from this conversion
	echi '                      hi' | sed 's/^[ ]*//'			#Means replace any number of space founded in the start of line with nothing
