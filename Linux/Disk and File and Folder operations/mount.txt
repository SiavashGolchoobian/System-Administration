#Mounting sdb1 device (usb flash) to media/sdb1 path
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1

#Unmounting sdb1 device (usb flash)
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
sudo umount -f /dev/sdb1		#force unmounting directory if it's in-use
sudo umount -l /dev/sdb1		#unmounting directory in lazy manner when it's in-use, and unmounting, file system as soon as the filesystem locks relaeased

#Get list of devices annt ther UUID'sdb1
sudo blkid

---------------------------------
#fstab file for auto mounting devices on startup
The /etc/fstab file is a configuration file that mount canuse. This file contains a list of all partitions known to the system. During the boot process, this list is read and the items in it are automatically mounted with the options specified therein
To see /dev/sdb1 block deviceâ€™s UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) run:
	blkid /dev/sdb1
To modify fstab file:
	echo 'UUID=ea8b08a4-3e9f-4482-83e9-c5f03b9f05d6 /data xfs defaults 1 1' >> /etc/fstab
	OR
	nano /etc/fstab
	fstab file format is like below:
	/dev/device	UUID									/dir/to/mount	fstype	options		dump		fsck
	-----------------------------------------			-------------	------	----------	-------		---------
	UUID=ea8b08a4-3e9f-4482-83e9-c5f03b9f05d6			/data			xfs		defaults		0			0
