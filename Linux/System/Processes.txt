#--Find zombie processes
When a process dies before all of its spawned child processes have completed. Such orphaned processes are called zombie processes. The orphaned child processes automatically inherit init(process id 1) as their parent process and this forms the basis of another one of init’s roles—the zombie reaper.
ps -ef				show a number of processes that will have a parent process ID (PPID) of 1. these processes are not all zombies !
