#Sort records(lines) inside <filepath> by it's first field delimited by space, by default.

	-t<delimiter>		#detect fields by <delimiter> character seperator, if this switch is ommited, by defaul space character is used as delimiter
	-k<n>				#sort lines ascending by key/field number <n>
	-k<n.x>				#sort lines ascending by key/field number <n> and <x>th character of that field
	-k<n.x>,<m.y>		#sort lines ascending by key/field number <n> and <x>th character of that field then by field number<m> and <y>th character of that field

Example01: Sort myfile1 records(lines) by it's first field delimited by space(by default)
	sort myfile1.txt
Example02: Sort myfile1 records(lines) by second field (as ascending string sort) and then by 3rd field (as descending numeric sort)
	sort -k2 -k3nr myfile1.txt
Example03:Sort passwd lines by userid/4th field (delimited by :) as numeric descending field
	sort -t : -k 4n /etc/passwd
Example04: Sort list by size from largest to smallest
