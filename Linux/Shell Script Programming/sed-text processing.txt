#Stream editor, edit stream of text in realtime, in sed stream unit of measure is line, then each line is a bucket in stream
sed [-n] [-i[.bak]] [<command>] <filename>
	-n							#run in silent mode (do not print content when read it, by default is disabled)
	-i							#do correction inplace (rewrite modifications on original input file), by default sed does not apply any modification on original file.
	-i.bak						#same as -i but before replace original file take backup from original one and then modify old file.
	<command>:
		p 						#print stream to stdout
		d 						#delete stream from stdout, for example delete second line from file.txt: sed -n '2d' file.txt
		<n>						#process line <n>, for example to pint first line: sed -n '1p' file.txt
		<n>,<m>					#process line <n> to <m>, for example to pint line 1 to 5: sed -n '1,5p' file.txt
		<n>,<+m>				#process line <n> to <n+m>, for example to pint line 1 till next 4 lines (or to line 5): sed -n '1,+4p' file.txt
		s/<oldtext>/<newtext>/[<n>|g]	
								#replace <n>'th occurranc of <oldtext> with <newtext> in input stream
								#g means all occurance (globally)
