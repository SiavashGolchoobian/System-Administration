The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. 

Install kubectl binary with curl on Windows
	1-Download the latest release v1.17.0 from this link (https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.17.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe).
	Or if you have curl installed, use this command:
		curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.17.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe
	To find out the latest stable version (for example, for scripting), take a look at https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt.

	2-Add the binary in to your PATH.
	3-Test to ensure the version of kubectl is the same as downloaded:
		kubectl version --client
		Note: Docker Desktop for Windows adds its own version of kubectl to PATH. If you have installed Docker Desktop before, you may need to place your PATH entry before the one added by the Docker Desktop installer or remove the Docker Desktop’s kubectl
		
----------------------------------
Install with Powershell from PSGallery
If you are on Windows and using Powershell Gallery package manager, you can install and update kubectl with Powershell.
    1-Run the installation commands (making sure to specify a DownloadLocation):
		Install-Script -Name install-kubectl -Scope CurrentUser -Force
		install-kubectl.ps1 [-DownloadLocation <path>]
        Note: If you do not specify a DownloadLocation, kubectl will be installed in the user’s temp Directory.
    2-The installer creates $HOME/.kube and instructs it to create a config file
    Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:
		kubectl version --client
        Note: Updating the installation is performed by rerunning the two commands listed in step 1

----------------------------------
Install on Windows using Chocolatey or Scoop
	1-To install kubectl on Windows you can use Chocolatey package manager command-line installer:
		choco install kubernetes-cli
    2-Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:
		kubectl version --client
    3-Navigate to your home directory:
		cd %USERPROFILE%
	4-Create the .kube directory:
		mkdir .kube
    5-Change to the .kube directory you just created:
		cd .kube
    6-Configure kubectl to use a remote Kubernetes cluster:
		New-Item config -type file
        Note: Edit the config file with a text editor of your choice, such as Notepad
