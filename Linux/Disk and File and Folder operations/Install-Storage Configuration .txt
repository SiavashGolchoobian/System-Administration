Alright, I assume that you tried to format and/or mount the 3rd (root) partition. You have to leave it unformatted and unmounted, this way the option for LVM remains.

NOTE: When you create the Logical Volumes inside of your Volume Group make sure to format and mount them, otherwise the installer will fail.
At the Storage Configuration step, move to AVAILABLE DEVICES and make the following changes:
	1-Create EFI or BIOS partition: 
		Under "AVAILABLE DEVICES" select your storage device (ex: /dev/sda), and from it's options select "Use As Boot Device".
	2-Create boot partition:
		Under "AVAILABLE DEVICES" select your storage device (ex: /dev/sda), and from it's options select "Add GPT Partition"
		set the size (ex: 1G), format as ext4 and mount at /boot.
	3-Create root partition:
		Under "AVAILABLE DEVICES" select your storage device (ex: /dev/sda), and from it's options select "Add GPT Partition", leave size empty (uses remaining disk space), do NOT format and do NOT mount (leave both options as unformatted/leave unmounted).
	4-Create Volume Group:
		Under "AVAILABLE DEVICES" select "Create volume group (LVM)"
		name it (ex: ubuntu-vg)
		and select partition 3 with the checkbox.
	5-Create Swap Logical Volume(s):
		Under "AVAILABLE DEVICES" select the newly created Volume Group (ex: ubuntu-vg)
		select "Create Logical Volume", name it "swap-lv", set size twice of your RAM
		set format to "swap"
	6-Create root Logical Volume(s):
		Under "AVAILABLE DEVICES" select the newly created Volume Group (ex: ubuntu-vg)
		select "Create Logical Volume", name it "ubuntu-lv", set size (or blank for remaining disk space), format it and mount it.
		set format to xfs or ext4
    7-Repeat step 6 for all the Logical Volumes you want to create.
