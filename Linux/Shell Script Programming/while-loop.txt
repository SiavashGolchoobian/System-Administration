#Create a while loop, make attention that you should have space around brackets

while <anything exists>;
do
	<any commands>
done

OR

while [ <true condition> ];
do
	<any commands>
done

OR

while test <true condition>;
do
	<any commands>
done

---Example1: in this sample we pipe /etc/passwd content to while loop and seperate it's user name from each line and print it.
cat /etc/passwd |
while read myline; do
echo $(echo $myline | cut -d : -f 1 )
done
