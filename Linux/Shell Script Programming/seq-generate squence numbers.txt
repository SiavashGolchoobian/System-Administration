#Generate a sequence of numbers start with <m> and end with <n> and increment values from <m> to <n> by <step> value.
seq <m> [<step>] <n>
	<step>			#If ommited by defualt set to 1 and increment value from <m> to <n>, one by one
-----Example:
seq 1 10			#generate sequential numbers from 1 to 10
seq 1 2 10			#generate numbers are 1,3,5,7,9
