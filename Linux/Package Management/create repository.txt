=================================How to create a Ubuntu repository server step by step

--Update the APT package repository cache with the following command:
sudo apt update

--As a first step we need to install the Apache HTTP Server which is under the package named apache2, with the command:
sudo apt install apache2

--Then make sure the service runs at startup:
sudo systemctl enable apache2

--move to the default DocumentRoot Directory (which is /var/www/html). There we can then create the sub-directory /var/www/html/ubuntu and assign it to the appropriate owner, in this case www-data ( the user under which Apache HTTP runs ).
cd /var/www/html
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/ubuntu
sudo chown 299294@saipacorp.com:dbadminsrvr@saipacorp.com /var/www/html/ubuntu

--it's preffered to mount a disk to /var/www/html/ubuntu/ path:
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /var/www/html/ubuntu/

--The main tool that allows us to create a local repository is apt-mirror, to install it execute:
sudo apt install apt-mirror

--In case the package is not found make sure to refresh the packages list first with below command and run above command again:
sudo apt update

--Selecting which repositories to mirror on the server. Once apt-mirror is installed we can make a backup copy of its configuration file /etc/apt/mirror.list, after that you make sure the line containing the option set base_path points to the correct path for our repository (by default is /var/spool/apt-mirror ).
sudo cp /etc/apt/mirror.list /etc/apt/mirror.list.org

--So you can now use your favorite editor to change the base_path option in the mirror.list file to /var/www/html/ubuntu; you need also to specify you are mirroring the "bionic" distro instead of "artful" (change accordingly if you have a different Ubuntu version) repos, always in the mirror.list configuration file. 
sudo nano /etc/apt/mirror.list

--Next you copy an important script into /var/www/html/ubuntu/var/
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/ubuntu/var 
sudo cp /var/spool/apt-mirror/var/postmirror.sh /var/www/html/ubuntu/var/

--Mirroring the selected repositories locally on the server. Now is time to create a local mirror, keep in mind that an initial mirroring (from archive.ubuntu.com only for this tutorial) can take a lot of time and slow down your connection so I would suggest you start this job at night. To start mirroring the remote repos packages to the local server simply execute the command:
sudo apt-mirror

--If you need to, you can interrupt this process ( with the classic CTRL+C combo ) and restart it later; it will resume from where was left. 

--Configuring automatic sync process by using cron scheduler. After our first sync is completed we need to create a cron job to make sure that we have an automatic up to date local repository; for instance we want this task to run every night at 2:00 AM and therefore:
sudo crontab -e
	#Then we edit the crontab to add the following line, And save and exit:
	00 	02 	*	 *	 *	/usr/bin/apt-mirror
	
--Test repository web panel by loading bellow url on browser
	http://10.0.0.42/ubuntu
	
=================================Configuring the Linux client to use the local repository server

--Configuring the local repository list. n any client which is going to use our local repository we need to edit the configuration file /etc/apt/sources.list specifying our local repo and disabling any remote one.
--It is recommended to comment any line in the /etc/apt/sources.list file referring to repositories not mirrored in our server, for instance, in this case, any line starting with deb-src and containing bionic-backports have been commented.
--If you don't do that you might get the error Release file has not been found when running the command apt update on the client. 
--First of all we replace any string "archive.ubuntu.com" with our local mirror IP, in this case 10.0.0.42. Of course your local IP address could be different.
	sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.org
	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
	replace "archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu" with "10.0.0.42/ubuntu/mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
	comment lines started with "http://us."
	comment lines containing "bionic-backports" keyword
--Update local repository index. Now you need to make sure the port 80 is not blocked by the client firewall and then you can run:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt-get update
