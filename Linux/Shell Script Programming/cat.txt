#Concat file contents and show concatenated contents, also can be used like print
cat [-n] <filepath1> <filepath2> ... <filepathN> [> <any output filename>] [<<\<any sign like EOF><any text><any sign like EOF>] [< <any input filename>]
cat <filepath>
	-n														#Show line number before each stdout lines
	> <any output filename>									#Send cat ouput to <any output filename> file
	<<\<any sign like EOF><any text><any sign like EOF>		#Get input from console instead of file, input should end with <any sign like EOF> phrase.
	< <any input filename>									#Get input of cat from <any input filename>, it's same as assign <filepath1> argument

-----Examples:
cat mydoc.txt > mydoc-copy.txt		#Copy mydoc.txt content to another file, named mydoc-copy.txt, if mydoc-copy.txt has any content it will be replaced by new content
cat mydoc.txt >> mydoc-copy.txt		#Append mydoc.txt content to another file, named mydoc-copy.txt
cat > mydoc-copy.txt < mydoc.txt	#Copy mydoc.txt content to another file, named mydoc-copy.txt, same as first example

cat > mydoc.txt <<\EOF

 it as text until see EOF word
 sign as mentioned in start of 
 command EOF should be typed in
 new line and should not have 
 any space around itself.
