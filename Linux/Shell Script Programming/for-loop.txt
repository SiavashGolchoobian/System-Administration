#Create a for loop

for <myLoop> in <myRange>
do
	<any commands>
done

------Example1:
for myLoop in $(seq 1 10)
do
echo "Row number $myLoop"
done

------Example2 (same as example1 but in one line:
for myLoop in $(seq 1 10);do echo "Row number $myLoop";done

------Example3: in this sample our range has 5 values (hello,world,1,2,3), attention that you should not use ";" symbol Immediately after "do" command
for myLoop in hello world 1 2 3
do
echo "Row is: $myLoop"
done

------Example4: in this sample our range has 5 values plus any number of filename in current directory because we use * inside the range (hello,world,*,1,2,3)
for myLoop in hello world * 1 2 3
do
echo "Row is: $myLoop"
done

------Example5: loop throughout each line of myfile.txt
for myLoop in $(cat myfile.txt)
do
echo "Row is: $myLoop"
done
